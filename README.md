# MovieFind

## What is MovieFind?

Ever wanted to watch a movie but then linger for an hour (or more) because you can't decide what to watch?
`MovieFind` is designed to prevent exactly that.


Netflix does an "okay" job at recommending things to watch after analyzing your "taste".


But we don't settle for "okay".


And thus - `MovieFind` was created.

## How does it work?

Our algorithm, carefully crafted to get you the most accurate results possible, was written by Dhivya S., our resident Machine Learning specialist.


Dan wrote the `Platform`, which allows you to get results as intuitively as possible, via the following steps:

- Head over to [MovieFind](https://moviefind.qoding.pt).

- Enter your Favorite Movie, when prompted.

- Get your results!


As easy as can be.

## How much?

That _is_ the question, isn't it?
The answer is quite simple: **nothing**.


We don't charge anything for `MovieFind` as a whole nor for our services / APIs.


You are free to use them, for as long as you like, whenever you like.


No hidden fees.

## Usage and Releases

### Platform

The `Platform` is available [here](https://moviefind.qoding.pt).


In the future, a Mobile App may also be released, if the project takes off and we deem it "necessary".

### API

The API can be accessed as such:

- `https://moviefindapi.herokuapp.com/movie?title=`.


The information returned by the API includes:

- Movie Title and Collection (if applicable).

- Movie Budget and Box Office revenue.

- Movie Details (Plot, Runtime, Release Date, etc).

- Movie Rating (as voted by viewers).

- Movie Cast & Crew (complete list).

- Movie Poster & Backdrop.


**Example API Call**: [Example](https://moviefindapi.herokuapp.com/movie?title=Interstellar).

## Contributions

If you want to contribute to the project, you can do so in two ways:

- Pull Requests - the most simple way to help.
- Donations.


As for the latter, we need to clarify something:


Although this project is free to use, it isn't free to maintain.


We're using Heroku to host our API, which means there are limits to the Bandwidth and Requests.


This means that, when these limits are reached, our API no longer functions, and thus `MovieFind` doesn't either.


For now, since this project is really "young" and people don't use it much, there is no link to donate.


But, if the project ends up being "popular", we will add a link so you can help keep the project alive.


Your name will - if you so desire - be added to the list of contributors on the `Platform`.
